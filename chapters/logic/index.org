* Logic Programming with Clojure's core.logic

  core.logic is a library for logic programming in Clojure.

** Logic Variables

   Logic variables can take anbiguous values, but only one value at a
   time. The solver (core.logic basically) can determine all the
   values for which given constraints are true. So what are those
   constraints?

** Constraints

   Constraints are expressions that must be true for valid Logic
   Variables. Here is an example:

   #+BEGIN_SRC clojure
   (require 'core.logic)

   ()

   #+END_SRC

* Project Setup

  #+BEGIN_SRC clojure :tangle project.clj
  (defproject clojure-literally/logic "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"
    :dependencies [[org.clojure/clojure "1.7.0"]
                   [org.clojure/core.logic "0.8.10"]])

  #+END_SRC
