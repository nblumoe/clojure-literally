* What is this?
  clojure-literally is a new style of learning resource. It combines
  traditional publication, website contents and actually executable
  code.

  You can think of clojure-literally as an interactive book about
  programming with Clojure.

  This is work in progress and not considered to be a released version
  yet. Nevertheless it is being created and developed in the public
  from the beginning on. Ideally this will become a community effort
  with many contributors. Don't be shy, please get in touch if you
  want to help with it. Pull requests, as well as any bug reports,
  wishes, suggestions and so on are very welcome.
